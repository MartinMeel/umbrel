  Sonarr is a PVR for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new episodes
  of your favorite shows and will grab, sort and rename them. It can also be configured to automatically
  upgrade the quality of files already downloaded when a better quality format becomes available.
  
  This version routes all traffic through Gluetun VPN for privacy and security.
