  CrushFTP is filled full of features. Features you might not use right away, 
  but eventually as your business grows you'll wonder if it can handle a new task. 
  Usually, the feature is already there, just waiting for you to explore and use it!
  First time users will be up and running in no time, and power users 
  won't be disappointed with a lack of options, controls, or functionality.
